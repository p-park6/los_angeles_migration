# Visualizing the Migration Patterns of Young Adults to Los Angeles within the United States

## Summary
At the age of 18, hundreds of thousands of young adults move out of their parents' place to start a new life for themselves. One of the most visited places, Los Angeles, is no exception. However, the question arises of how many people actually move to Los Angeles and from where. This repository shows the steps I took to find out what the top ten cities young adults were coming from to move to Los Angeles, as well as other steps taken to create these visualizations. The three top questions that I asked and answered through various visualizations were:

1. Where on the map are they coming from? (Map visualization)
2. About how many people from the cities are moving to Los Angeles? (Lollipop Visualization)
3. How does the total number of these people that are moving from those cities compare to the population that is already living in Los Angeles? (bar graph visualization)

## Visualization

Additional information on how I created this visualization can be found on my blog here.

## Data
Data was gathered from the website [https://migrationpatterns.org/](https://migrationpatterns.org/). Multiple sources were gathered to create the dataset, including US Cencus data, American Community Survey data, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. All data range from 1994 to 2018. Data can be downloaded [here](https://data.migrationpatterns.org/MigrationPatternsData.zip) directly from the website.
